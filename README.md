# Catastrophes Mod [Started 10/21/2020]

Mod Description
---------------
The Catastrophes Mod currently adds three disasters or events called "Catastrophes". Each Catastrophe has its own unique properties, bringing a challenge to your minecraft world. One such Catastrophe is the Thalassic Deluge, which slowly engulfs the world with water, forcing players to move far above the surface. Who knows what lurks in the drink below. The Catastrophes Mod does limit world size for functionality. To compensate, the most powerful Catastrophe, The Ender, almost entirely destroys and then regenerates the world. The only substance kept from the previous world is that which you stashed in your ender chest. The world will be regenerated, and players recieve varying gifts in the form of, for instance, an elytra, a conduit, exp levels, a permanent health boost, and so on. The Nether Dimension is disabled, and instead implemented into the overworld via the Hadean Earth Catastrophe. The Sun becomes so close that it boils the surface of the world, essentially turning it into a Nether. Keep in mind that this mod will impact your world considerably.
