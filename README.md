# Catastrophes Mod [Started 10/21/2020]

Mod Description
---------------
The Catastrophes Mod will add (#) disasters or events called "Catastrophes". Each Catastrophe has its own unique properties, bringing a challenge to your minecraft world. One such Catastrophe is the Thalassic Deluge, which slowly engulfs the world with water, forcing players to move far above the surface. Who knows what lurks in the drink below. The Catastrophes Mod does limit world size for functionality. To compensate, the most powerful Catastrophe, The Ender, almost entirely destroys and then regenerates the world. The only substance kept from the previous world is that which you stashed in your ender chest. On world regeneration, players recieve varying gifts in the form of an elytra, a conduit, exp levels, a permanent health boost, and so on. The Nether Dimension is disabled, and instead implemented into the overworld via the Hadean Earth Catastrophe, which is the counterpart to the Thalassic Deluge Catastrophe. The Sun becomes so close that it boils the surface of the world, essentially turning it into a Nether. Most items in the game will be accessible one way or another because of the small world size, whether that is through crafting, or other means. Keep in mind that this mod will impact your world considerably. The final stage of this project is to make it server compatible, so you and all of your friends can suffer through hell together.
